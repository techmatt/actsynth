# activity-scene-modeling
Activity-centric Scene Synthesis for Functional 3D Scene Modeling

The paper, database, and latest information for this project can be found here:

http://graphics.stanford.edu/projects/actsynth/

 Note that porting this codebase to a github project is a work-in-progress,
 and the project is incomplete with necssary external dependencies not
 included and missing references to the underlying database stores needed
 by the synthesis pipeline. We are working to incorporate the dependencies
 and otherwise update the codebase so it can be used by others.
